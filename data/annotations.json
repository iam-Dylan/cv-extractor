In my thesis, I present Wilo (Wifi\nLocalization), an Indoor Location-Based Mobile Recommender Application. Wilo uses a\nWi-Fi fingerprint-based technique to localize current location of user and from that it gives\nsuggestion on local events. Additionally, Wilo is integrated with a Points and Reward system\nthat can be applied to many different contexts in reality to keep users stay longer in places\nor to reward users by their loyalty. The thesis also present a solution to solve a\ncommon problem that can be encountered in Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor localization\ncalled Out of Map problem.\nBùi Duy Quốc Nghị\n2\n\n§ Project team size: 2\n§ Role: Mobile Developer\n§ Skill Set Utilized: Android, Socket, HTTPRequest,Eclipse\n§ Assignment Duration: June 2013- September 2012\nVideo demo : https://www.dropbox.com/s/h1qq3szypxzh8f5/%5BFinal%5DDemo.mp4\nREFERENCES\nhttps://bitbucket.org/bdqnghi\nhttps://www.facebook.com/x.tiger91\nBùi Duy Quốc Nghị\n3\n",{"entities":[[4230,4247,"PERSON"]]}],["\nCurriculum Vitae\n\n\n\\\n\n► Name : CHENH HENH PHAT\n\n► Date of Birth : 05/08/1994\n\n► Address : 100/3/8, Dat Thanh Street, Ward 6, District Tan Binh, HCM\n\n► Mobile : 01254272896\n\n► E- mail : Hungphat812@gmail.com\n\n2012-2015\nBACHELOR OF INFORMATICS\n\nMajor: Information Technology\n\nInstitution: University of Science Ho Chi Minh City\n6/2014 -
